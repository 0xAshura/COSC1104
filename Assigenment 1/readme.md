## Description
This Python script analyzes whether a number is a prime number and provides additional information around it. It checks for the prime number before the entered number, verifies if the number is prime, lists its divisors if it isn't, and finds the next prime number after the entered number.

## How It Works
1. The user is prompted to enter a positive whole number.
2. The script validates the input to ensure it is a positive whole number.
3. The script determines the prime number before and after the entered number.
4. The script checks if the entered number is prime and lists its divisors if it is not.

## Usage
To run this script:
1. Ensure you have Python installed.
2. Run the script by executing `python3 prime_number.py` in your terminal or command prompt.
3. Follow the prompts to enter a positive whole number.

## Sample Output
```plaintext
Enter a positive whole number: 10
The prime number before 10 is 7.
10 is not a prime number. Divisors: [1, 2, 5, 10]
The next prime number after 10 is 11.
